PRODUCTION DAILY PIPELINE

Runs every day at 6 AM during NFL season.

Tasks:
1. Download latest NFL data (stats, injuries, weather)
2. Get today's NFL schedule from ESPN API
3. Calculate alert times (1 hour before each game)
4. Schedule notifications
5. Update features for upcoming games

This is the foundation of the automated betting system.
